# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
I have been so interested to start week 0 with Andrew Brown and to gain new knowledge in working with a real life cloud project .
I am really keen on getting my first hands on experience in Andrew Brown's AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp. 
Week 0 was about how to control billing and setting up aws account , preparing a desgin for aws architecture using lucid charts , for our cruddur wep based application .

## Lessons learned so far :
#Ask dump questions :
