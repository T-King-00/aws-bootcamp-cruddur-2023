# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

This week was about configurating our gitpod workspace and writing dockerfiles for our backend and front end .
We also created a docker compose file (The Compose file is a YAML file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker application. ) to help us define and share multi-container application.
Docker compose helps us in bootstrapping containers at same time .
