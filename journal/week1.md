# Week 1 — App Containerization

This week was about configurating our gitpod workspace and writing dockerfiles for our backend and front end .
We also created a docker compose file (The Compose file is a YAML file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker application. ) to help us define and share multi-container application.
Docker compose helps us in bootstrapping containers at same time .

-learned about envirnoment variables and their use cases as 
-- Execution mode (e.g., production, development, staging, etc.)
-- Domain names
-- API URL/URI’s
-- Public and private authentication keys (only secure in server applications)
-- Service account names


# Homework 
- Knew how to implement a health check in both docker file or docker compose file .
- Implemented health check for backend container
